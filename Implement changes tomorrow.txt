To make your site images more responsive and ensure the map fills all available space, follow these steps:

---

### 1. Make Images in `#info-box-full > img` Responsive

Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

````css
/* ...existing code... */
#info-box-full > img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 100%;   /* Ensures image never exceeds container width */
    height: auto;      /* Maintains aspect ratio */
    border-radius: 8px; /* Optional: rounded corners for a modern look */
}
/* ...existing code... */
````

### 2. Make the Map in index.html Fully Responsive

**Update your HTML:**

Change this line in index.html:
```html
<img src="images/map.png" width="100%" alt="This is a map of Pine City Zoo">
```
to:
```html
<img src="images/map.png" class="responsive-map" alt="This is a map of Pine City Zoo">
```

**Add this CSS:**
````css
.responsive-map {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
    max-width: 100vw; /* Prevents overflow on very small screens */
}
````

If you want the map to always fill the available vertical space as well, you can use:
````css
#main-home, .responsive-map {
    width: 100vw;
    max-width: 100vw;
    height: auto;
}
````
